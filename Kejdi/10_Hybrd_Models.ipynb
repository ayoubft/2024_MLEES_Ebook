    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Glacier Flow\n",
    "Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that flow slowly under their own weight. The flow of ice in a glacier is a complex process governed by physical laws that describe how the ice deforms and moves.\n",
    "Given an initial glacier geometry, the time evolution in ice thickness $h(x, y, t)$ is determined by the mass conservation equation, which couples ice dynamics and surface mass balance (SMB)\n",
    "through: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}h) = SMB,\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla \\cdot$ denotes the divergence operator with respect to horizontal variables $(x, y)$, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the vertically averaged horizontal ice velocity field and SMB the SMB function, which consists of the\n",
    "integration of ice accumulation and ablation over one year. Equation (1) is generic and can be applied to model glacier evolution in number of applications provided adequate SMB and ice-flow model components. \n",
    "In the following, we mostly focus on developing an efficient numerical method to compute the ice-flow considering it is often the most computationally expensive component in glacier evolution model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we will use a numerical solution to compute $\\mathbf{u}$. \n",
    "- Then we will use a data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approach that emulates ice-flow (Jouvet and others, 2022). \n",
    "The state of the art ML techniques ( Jouvet and Cordonnier, 2023), use a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN); however, this goes beyond the scope of this chapter which focuses on hybrid models.\n",

    "## 2. The Glen-Stokes Equations\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Stokes Equations for Glacier Flow\n",

    "- $\\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector of the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Glen's Flow Law\n",
    "Glen's flow law relates the strain rate (deformation rate) of the ice to the applied stress. This relationship is crucial for understanding how ice deforms under pressure and is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Glen-Stokes equations describe the flow of ice under stress, but their computational cost makes them impractical for large-scale ice-sheet modeling over long time periods. This leads us to introduce the **shallow ice approximation (SIA)**, which is used in ice sheet models due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIA simplifies the full Stokes equations by assuming that the ice flow is dominated by vertical shear stresses and that horizontal stresses can be neglected.

    "- $s$ is the surface slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation governs the horizontal velocity of ice based on the local ice thickness and slope, and is more computationally feasible than the full Glen-Stokes model.\n",
